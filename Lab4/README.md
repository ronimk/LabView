The Idea for Week 4 was to get acquainted with labview's I/O-functionality before the final project for the course.

Exercise 1 takes in personal info (last name, first name and age) and saves it into the given file.
Exercise 2 displays the contents of the CSV-file created using the interface of exercise 1.
